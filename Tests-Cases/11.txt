// Test 1
//
// Main Test Idea:
// ---------------
// - Test that a TX with a lock at a failed site fails to commit
// - Test that a TX can get locks for a variable after a site holding the var is noticed
//   to be down by the TM. What should happen is that by the time the TX goes to write the
//   variable, the variable should have already been re-replicated at another site, and
//   thus the TX should write to a full 3 sites.
// - Test the re-replication and load-balancing
//
// Variable x1 is at site 2
// Variable x3 is at site 4
// Variables x2 and x8 are at site 1, so:
// T2 should fail to commit, as it has a write lock at site 1 which is down at that time
// T1 should be fine, since TM knows at the time T1 goes for x8 that site 1 is down
// T3 should write x2 to three sites, maybe site 1 maybe not
//
// Should also see some variable replication related to site 1 being down
