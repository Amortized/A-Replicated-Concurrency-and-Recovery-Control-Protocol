// Test 2
//
// Main Test Idea:
// ---------------
// - Test that when a TX tries to get a lock at a failed site which hasn't
//   been down for 3 time steps, and thus that the TM has yet to mark as down,
//   the TX tries to get a lock on that site for the variable and eventually
//   fails, either at commit time or via a timeout.
//
// Variable x2 is at site 2, so T1 should be told by TM to get a lock there
// Thus T1 should fail to commit
